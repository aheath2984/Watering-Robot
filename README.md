This is a project I took part in over the summer of 2025. My goal was to improve the design of a water delivery robot and to fix many of the issues that it faced in the beginning of the project. This task proved to be challenging due to the construction of our new Engineering building at MTSU, since all of the equipment being used was being actively moved thoughout the project. With this being said, the project was still completed a few days ahead of schedule and this post highlights some of the aspects I designed and a video demonstration of the robot delivering the water supply. For more information I will have a document outlining the project, and I am open to any questions!
